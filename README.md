# Understanding-Hedging-Using-Monte-Carlo-Simulations
We will create a portfolio of one stock and one put option and compare it to portfolio of only one stock.
We will compare the two portfolios on the following: Their Distributions, Average portfolio value after a year, Standard deviation, Value at Risk, Expected Shortfall, Max gains and Min losses.
We will be simulating stock prices under the assumptions of the Black-Scholes Model.
To simulate stock prices, we will use Monte Carlo Simulations.
