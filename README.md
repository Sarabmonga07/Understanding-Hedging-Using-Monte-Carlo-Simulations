# Understanding-Hedging-Using-Monte-Carlo-Simulations
We will create a portfolio of one stock and one put option and compare it to portfolio of only one stock. The time period will be one year. We will be simulating stock prices under the assumptions of the Black-Scholes Model.
To simulate stock prices, we will use Monte Carlo Simulations.
We will compare the two portfolios on the following: Their Distributions, Average portfolio value after a year, Standard deviation, Value at Risk, Expected Shortfall, Max gains and Min losses.
