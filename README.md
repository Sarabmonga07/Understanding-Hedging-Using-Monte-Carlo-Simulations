# Understanding-Hedging-Using-Monte-Carlo-Simulations
TOPIC: Understanding Hedging
Create a portfolio of one stock and one put option and compare it to portoflio of only one stock.
We will compare the two portfolios on these: Distributions, Average portfolio value, Standard deviation, Value at Risk, Expected Shortfall, Max gains and Min losses.
We will be simulating stock prices under the assumptions of the Black-Scholes Model.
To simulate stock prices, we will use Monte Carlo Simulations.
